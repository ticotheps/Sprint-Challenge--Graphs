#------------------------UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM-----------------------

#  Problems: 
#     (1) The list of [traversal] directions provided is NOT complete.
#     (2) There is no current graph that represents all 500 rooms in the
#         game.
#     (3) All the tests in adv.py DO NOT pass when the code is executed.
    
#  Provided Specs:
#     (1) This is an adventure game.
#     (2) The game has a total of 500 rooms that can be visited by a player.
#     (3) The game only has ONE player (you).
#     (4) Through the list of directions in 'traversalPath,' you can
#         perform ONE move at a time, and each move will be made in ONE of 
#         the following directions: 
#            (a) n (North)
#            (b) s (South) 
#            (c) e (East) 
#            (d) w (West) 

#  Player's Objective: 
#     (1) Visit all 500 rooms in the SHORTEST number of moves possible.
#     (2) Construct a dictionary that represents a graph of all 500 
#         rooms, filling the dictionary one entry at a time, AS the player 
#         is traversing through all 500 rooms.
#            (a) i.e. - {
#                         0: {'n': '?', 's': 5, 'w': '?', 'e': '?'},
#                         5: {'n': 0, 's': '?', 'e': '?'}
#                       }
#     (3) Create a list of directions called 'traversalPath' that 
#         stores [the directions of] each move you make while visiting
#         all 500 rooms.
#            (a) The moves will be stored in sequential order with index 0
#                being the very FIRST move that is made from the 
#                'startingRoom'.
#                   (i) i.e. - traversalPath = ['n', 'e']
#     (4) You will know when you all 500 rooms have been visited if the
#         following TWO conditions have been met:
#            (a) There are a total of 500 entries in your adjacency 
#                dictionary.
#            (b) There are no more "?" values in the adjacency lists within
#                your adjacency dictionary.

#  Hints:
#     (1) Try traversing the smaller graphs in adv.py first.

#     (2) Use Depth First Traversal (DFT) to write an algorithm that: 
#           (a) picks a RANDOM, unexplored exit from the player's 
#               CURRENT room.
#           (b) moves the player in the chosen direction to get to
#               the NEXT room.
#           (c) adds the player's move (as a direction, such as 'n',
#               's', 'e', or 'w') into the 'traversalPath' list.
#           (d) loops through steps (a) - (c) to continually move the 
#               player through unexplored exits, until the player reaches
#               a DEAD-END room with NO UNEXPLORED exits available (meaning
#               there are no more "?" values in the adjacency list for that
#               room).
#           (e) walks the player back to the NEAREST room that DOES
#               contain an UNEXPLORED exit (meaning there IS at least
#               ONE "?" value in the adjacency list for that room).
#           (f) repeats steps (a) - (e) until all 500 rooms have been
#               visited and each room no longer contains ANY "?" in their
#               adjacency lists.

#     (3) Use a Breadth First Search (BFS) to find the SHORTEST path 
#         to the NEAREST room with an UNEXPLORED exit (when the player
#         has reached a DEAD-END room with DFS).
#            (a) Set your 'destination_vertex' to a value of "?", which
#                will search for the shortest path to a room with a
#                "?" as ONE of its "exit" values.
#            (b) If a room has NO "?" value for any of it's "exit" values
#                (because all exits have been explored) you can put it in
#                your BFS queue like normal.
#            (c) BFS will return the shortest path as a LIST of room IDs.
#                   (i)  Every move that the player makes to get to this
#                        'nearest room with an unexplored exit' must ALSO 
#                        be added to the 'traversalPath' list.
#                   (ii) Each move will need to be converted from a room
#                        ID to an actual DIRECTION (i.e. - north(n), 
#                        south(s), etc.) before it can be added to the
#                        'traversalPath' list.

#     (4) Do not use a STACK as the data structure for your DFT & BFS!
#            (a) Using a DEQUE as the data structure for your DFT and BFS
#                methods will be superior to using a STACK because:
#                   (i)  DEQUES (double-ended queues) allow for the fast 
#                        addition & removal of elements from BOTH ends 
#                        of the queue, whereas elements in a STACK can 
#                        only be added or removed from the end of a STACK.
#                   (ii) DEQUES also have built-in methods that STACKS do
#                        not, such as:
#                           (a) .append()
#                           (b) .appendLeft()
#                           (c) .pop()
#                           (d) .popLeft()
#                           (e) .reverse() 

#     (5) Once all exits have been explored, the game is over!

#------------------------------DEVISE A PLAN-----------------------------

#     (1) Use BFS (with a DEQUE) when the player reaches a room that has NO
#         exits or has NO UNEXPLORED exits available at the player's 
#         current room.

#     (2) Use DFT (with a DEQUE) to move the player through UNEXPLORED 
#         exits.
#            (a) Create an adjancency dictionary [of adjacency lists] that 
#                will store an updated log of 'room' entries for each room 
#                that the player has already visited. 
#            (b) Each 'room' entry in the adjacency dictionary will store 
#                an adjacency list of 'exit' values (i.e. - '?', 'n', 's', 'e', 'w').
#            (c) Create a DEQUE called 'traversalPath' that will store 
#                a list of each move (in the form of a direction, such as:
#                "n", "s", "e", "w") that the player makes, from the start
#                of the game to the end of the game. 
#            (d) Use a WHILE loop that will continue (so long as the the
#                number of entries in the dictionary is < 500) to move the 
#                player from room to room AS LONG AS the player continues
#                to enter rooms that have UNEXPLORED exits in them.
#                available, which will also include rooms with 0 exits.
#                   (i)   If an unexplored exit exists at the current room...
#                          (1) ...and if the current room already exists in
#                              the dictionary of 'room' entries...
#                                 (a) continue with the outer IF
#                                     statement.
#                          (2) ...and if it does NOT already exist in the
#                              dictionary of 'room' entries...
#                                 (b) then add it and continue with the
#                                     outer IF statement.
#                          (3) move the player through a randomly-chosen, 
#                              unexplored exit to the NEXT room. 
#                          (4) log the player's move in a DEQUE you'll
#                              create called 'traversalPath'. 
#                          (5) Then, exit this IF statement & re-enter the
#                              outer WHILE loop to evaluate the next room.
#                   (ii)  If an unexplored exit DOES NOT exist at the 
#                         current room, call the BFS helper method, which 
#                         will utilize the same DICT and the same DEQUE 
#                         ('traversalPath') as this DFT method, but will
#                         also utilize a newly created DEQUE with the 
#                         shortest BACKWARDS path, to the NEAREST room that
#                         contains an unexplored exit.
#                           (1) Pass in the player's 'current room' as the
#                               'starting_vertex' and pass in a "?" as the 
#                               'destination_vertex' for the BFS method. 
#                           (2) Use the built-in ".reverse()" DEQUE method 
#                               to reverse the order of 'traversalPath' 
#                               ([left:right] ==> [right:left]) to allow
#                               for BACKWARDS traversing of the
#                               'traversalPath' list.
#                           (3) Perform the BFS method on the newly-
#                               reversed 'traversalPath' to RETURN a new
#                               DEQUE of the shortest path (as a list 
#                               of ROOM IDs) to the nearest room with 
#                               an unexplored exit.
#                           (4) Use a FOR loop to iterate through the 
#                               'shortest path' list of room IDs to:
#                                  (a) convert each room ID into a 
#                                      DIRECTION (i.e. - "n", "s", "e", 
#                                      "w") by comparing the room ID
#                                      (from the 'shortest path' list)
#                                      to the values of the 'room' entries
#                                      in the adjacent dictionary that 
#                                      you've been creating with each
#                                      move, this entire time.
#                                  (b) move the player according to that
#                                      newly-converted direction.
#                                  (c) add that newly-converted direction
#                                      to the BEGINNING of the 
#                                      'traversalPath' DEQUE, using
#                                      DEQUE'S built-in ".appendLeft()"
#                                      method.
#                                  (d) Once the player has traversed
#                                      through the 'shortest path' list,
#                                      to arrive at the designated room
#                                      (with the unexplored exit), set
#                                      the 'starting_vertex' for the DFT
#                                      method equal to the player's CURRENT
#                                      room, which will allow the player
#                                      to enter the FIRST WHILE loop (upon
#                                      exiting this FOR loop), from
#                                      the DFT method at the start.
#                           (5) Use the ".reverse()" built-in DEQUE method 
#                               AGAIN to UN-reverse the CURRENT order of the
#                               'traversalPath', from [right:left] BACK to 
#                               [left:right], which will allow the player 
#                               to traverse through the rooms in the 
#                               ORIGINAL direction, once the player 
#                               re-enters the DFT WHILE loop, WITH a new 
#                               'starting_vertex'.

#     (3) MVP: Get all the tests to pass.
#     (4) MVP: Get the length of 'traversalPath' to be < 2000 moves total.
#     (5) ***STRETCH***: Achieve a 'traversalPath' length of < 1000 moves.
